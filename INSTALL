REQUIREMENTS

To compile the OTR plugin for pidgin, you'll need at least:
 - libgpg-error 1.0  [ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgpg-error/]
 - libgcrypt 1.2.0   [ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/]
 - libotr 3.1.0      [http://otr.cypherpunks.ca/]
 - glib 2.6          [http://www.gtk.org/download/]
 - gtk+ 2.6          [http://www.gtk.org/download/]
 - pidgin 2.x        [http://pidgin.im/]

You'll also need the usual autotools, such as automake-1.9, autoreconf,
libtool, intltool, etc.

If you install these with a package manager, you'll probably need the
-dev or -devel versions of the packages.

COMPILING (non-Win32)

If you're got a CVS copy, you will need to regenerate the configure
script using:

    intltoolize --force --copy
    autoreconf -s -i

[If you installed libotr.m4 somewhere that autoreconf can't find it,
you can try putting "ACLOCAL_FLAGS= -I /path/to/share/aclocal" at the
top of Makefile.am.]

Once you have the configure script (which comes with the source
deistribution), run it with any options that may be necessary for your
system.  Some examples:

Linux:
    ./configure --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man

NETBSD:
    CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/pkg/include" LDFLAGS="-R/usr/pkg/lib -L/usr/pkg/lib" \
	./configure --prefix=/usr/pkg

Once the configure script writes a Makefile, you should be able to just
run "make".

If you want a plugin that has libgcrypt linked statically, use
"make -f Makefile.static".  Makefile.static assumes libotr.a and libgcrypt.a
are available in /usr/lib.  If they're somewhere else, use something like
"LIBOTRDIR=/usr/local/lib make -f Makefile.static".

COMPILING (Win32)

Use the provided Makefile.mingw:

    make -f Makefile.mingw

INSTALLATION

You should be able to simply do "make install".  If you want to install
somewhere other than / (this is useful for package creators), use
something like "make DESTDIR=/path/to/install/to install".
